            postBody: "React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components. With ReactNative, you don't build a mobile web app, an HTML5 app, or a hybrid app; you build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. ReactNative uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.",
